It provides an interface for creating, reading, updating and deleting of contacts. 
In addition, the application also provides a way for administrators to manage contact
types, users, and delete any contact.

== Requirements

* Use Spring via Spring Boot
* Use PostgreSQL as the RDBMS
* Use migrations via Flyway
* Use SpringSecurity - HTTP Basic and UserDetailService
interface for authentication of users by email and password
and enable role type based access for users with ADMIN or USER roles
* Use Swagger
* Validate requests
* Global Exception Handler

== Tech stack

* Java 19
* Maven - Maven Wrapper 3.8.4
* Spring Boot 2.7.5
* PostgreSQL 14
* Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and deployment

== Design

Project is organized in a single module. Following packages can be found in the project:

* `config` - classes related to Security and Swagger configuration
* `controller` - classes for Admin and User controller, and `ApplicationExceptionHandler`,
DTO's and Mappers
* `domain` - classes related to Entities and Repositories
* `services` - classes related to Services and custom Exceptions

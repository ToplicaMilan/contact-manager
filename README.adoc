= Phonebook Manager

Phonebook Manager is a simple Spring Boot application that allows users to manage their contacts. 
It provides an interface for creating, reading, updating and deleting of contacts. 
In addition, the application also provides a way for users with Admin role to manage contact
types, users with User role, and delete any contact.

== Requirements

* Use Spring via Spring Boot
* Use PostgreSQL as the RDBMS
* Use migrations via Flyway
* Use SpringSecurity - HTTP Basic and UserDetailService
interface for authentication of users by email and password
and enable authorization by role type based access of ADMIN
and USER
* Use Swagger
* Validate requests
* Global Exception Handler

== Tech stack

* Java 19
* Maven - Maven Wrapper 3.8.4
* Spring Boot 2.7.5
* PostgreSQL 14
* Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and deployment

== Design

Project is organized in a single module. Following packages can be found in the project:

* `config` - classes related to Security and Swagger configuration
* `controller` - classes for Admin and User controller, and `ApplicationExceptionHandler`,
DTO's and Mappers
* `domain` - classes related to Entities and Repositories
* `services` - classes related to Services and custom Exceptions

== Building application

Project was generated with Spring Initializr - it includes Maven Wrapper.

.Building the application
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean install # -DskipTests
----

== Running application

=== Running from command line

Application requires PostgreSQL database for persistence.

. Start the application

=== Using Docker Compose

link:docker-compose.yaml[Docker Compose file] is included in project to start the application quicker.

. Start services
+
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

. Explore http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html[the API]. Username: milan2 Password: 1234

== Improvements

This section will list all the things I didnâ€™t manage to cover using the best practices, due to lack of time (or knowledge).

* Write multistage buld Dockerfile that runs ./mvnw clean package command.

* Implement Jib Maven plugin for building container images for Java applications.

* Write Unit tests.

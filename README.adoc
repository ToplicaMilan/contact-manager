= Phonebook Manager

Phonebook Manager is a simple Spring Boot application that allows users with "USER" role to
manage their contacts. It provides an REST API for creating, retrieving, updating and deleting
of contacts. In addition, the application also provides a way for users with "ADMIN" role to
create/edit/delete contact types, create/edit/retreive users with "USER" role and delete any contact.

== Requirements

* Use Spring via Spring Boot
* Use PostgreSQL as the RDBMS
* Use migrations via Flyway
* Use SpringSecurity - HTTP Basic and UserDetailService
interface for authentication of users by email and password
and enable authorization for role type based access to certain
endpoints with "ADMIN" or "USER" roles
* Use Swagger
* Validate requests
* Global Exception Handler

== Tech stack

* Java 19
* Maven - Maven Wrapper 3.8.4
* Spring Boot 2.7.5
* PostgreSQL 14
* Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and deployment

== Design

Project is organized in a single module. Following packages can be found in the project:

* `config` - classes related to Security and Swagger configuration
* `controller` - classes for Admin and User controller, and `ApplicationExceptionHandler`,
DTO's and Mappers
* `domain` - classes related to Entities and Repositories
* `services` - classes related to Services and custom Exceptions

== Building application

Project was generated with Spring Initializr - it includes Maven Wrapper.

.Building the application
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean install # -DskipTests
----

== Running application

=== Running from command line

Application requires PostgreSQL database for persistence.

. Start the application
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

. Explore http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html[the API]. Username: milan2 Password: 1234

=== Using Docker Compose

link:docker-compose.yaml[Docker Compose file] is included in project to start the application quicker.

. Start services
+
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

. Explore http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html[the API]. Username: milan2 Password: 1234

== Improvements

This section will list all the things I didnâ€™t manage to cover using the best practices, due to lack of time (or knowledge).

* Write multistage buld Dockerfile that runs ./mvnw clean package command.

* Implement Jib Maven plugin for building container images for Java applications.

* Write Unit tests.
